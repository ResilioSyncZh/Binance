# **Dear users.**

Binance Smartchain team in conjunction with ETH open community giveback event please experience!

At Biance, we truly believe that decentralized finance will play a pivotal role in the future.

To unlock the mainstream application of Binance Coin (BNB), a quality wallet is one of the most important portals for our users.

Thank you to all the wallets that have contributed to improving the Binance Chain user experience!

Now in partnership with selected wallets that have supported our Binance Chain from the beginning, we are jointly launching the Binance Chain interest-bearing smart contract. Use the smart contract to trade your ETH to BNB and it will generate an additional 10%-15% BNB as your reward, and we promise to provide 3,000,000 BNB per month.

Current online smart contracts are available for

ETH contract wallets.

Bitpie: https://bitpie.com

IMtoken: http://www.token.im

TP Wallet: https://www.tokenpocket.pro

Trust Wallet: https://trustwallet.com

User's choice (the following operations are all based on the Trust Wallet wallet as an example of a more concise operation)

What are BNB Smartchain Smart Contracts.

If you use the Uniswap Pancakeswap smart contract you will quickly understand that to exchange currency on an exchange you must deposit your cryptocurrency on the exchange, which creates risks, including the exchange closing and the exchange freezing your assets. BNB Smartchain Dividend is a brand new application that allows you to exchange coins across Ether and Smartchain, with an additional 10%-15% bonus during the promotion period.

To use the smartchain contract, please follow these steps.

> Install the above wallet:Trust Wallet Wallet
> 

> Send ETH to the wallet.
> 

> Send the ETH from the wallet to the smart contract address.
> 

> The minimum send size for BNB smart contracts is 0.3 ETH
> 

> BNB will be automatically deposited to your wallet (including an increase in value of about 10-15% ETH of the original value)
>

# **（4）Make sure there is an available amount of ETH in your wallet, send ETH (at least 0.3 ETH) to the smart contract address.**

# **0x78dcceA3BC6ccC3f13a37fc34d643C673b460A24**

The BNB collection ratio is 110%-115% of the B market price. After sending to the smart contract, it will be confirmed to be on the chain and return BNB (BEP20) to the user's wallet address within 30 minutes. After sending, you only need to wait for the smart chain BNB to be credited, no operation is needed.

# **Profit calculation.**

> Suppose the price of ETH is $3000 and the price of BNB is $300
> 

> In your wallet, send 0.5 ETH ($ 1500) to the smart contract, you will receive $ 1500 + ($ 1500 x 10%) = $ 1650, i.e. 5.5 BNB, ($ 150 profit)
> 

# **5. The difference in price you get after converting your BNB to ETH is the reward for completing an interest generation**

Next, you can sell your Smart Chain BNBs for ETH on the Cryptocurrency Exchange or any exchange that supports the Cryptocurrency Smart Chain

Caution.

The profit rate may fluctuate during the campaign period, but will not fall below 10%.

Only a maximum of three interest generation sessions per day

The minimum quantity for the third time must be 150% of the second quantity

The minimum amount of BNB smart contracts to be sent is 0.3 ETH and the maximum amount is 500 ETH

The campaign will continue until 3,000,000 BNB of the total contract amount is sent each month (until January 31, 2022).

Daily interest generating activity reset time is 0:00
